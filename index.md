## Welcome to Web Accessibility

Hey, so you want your homepage to be more inclusive? We'd like to help you with that :)

Web accessibility guides and advice online are heavily geared towards businesses and public services. This doesn't make the advice wrong by any means, but it can make it hard to read, and to connect with the rather different goals of a personal website.

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) has covered almost everything, which is great. It also has almost everything, which is... a lot.

We'll take it bit by bit, and try to apply it to our homepages.

## The WCAG Principles
- **Perceivable**: Users are able to perceive the content, using one or more of their senses.
- **Operable**: Users are able to control UI elements (e.g. buttons must be 'clickable' with a mouse, keyboard, voice command, etc.).
- **Understandable**: The content is understandable to its users.
- **Robust**: The content is built with web standards that work across different browsers, now and in the future.

## Here's a little of what I hope to cover:
- Disability spectrum
- Semantic HTML
- Image ALT text
- Focusable elements
- Responsive (zoomable) design
- Colors and contrast
- Using dev tools
