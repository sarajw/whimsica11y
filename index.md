# Welcome to Web Accessibility

Hey, so you want your homepage to be more inclusive? We'd like to help you with that :)

Web accessibility guides and advice online are heavily geared towards businesses and public services. This doesn't make the advice wrong by any means, but it can make it hard to read, and to connect with the rather different goals of a personal website.

## Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
The WCAG have covered almost everything, which is great. It also has almost everything, which is... a lot.

They're available for everyone to read. It's worth trying if you would like some solid bedtime reading! There is a lot to chew through though, so I would recommend it more as a reference. When something seems unclear in any accessibility advice you've read, go search for the issue you're concerned about and see if it clears it up for you:

[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/)

We'll take it bit by bit, and try to apply its principles to our homepages.

## The WCAG Principles
- **Perceivable**: Users are able to perceive the content, using one or more of their senses.
- **Operable**: Users are able to control UI elements (e.g. buttons must be 'clickable' with a mouse, keyboard, voice command, etc.).
- **Understandable**: The content is understandable to its users.
- **Robust**: The content is built with web standards that work across different browsers, now and in the future.

## WCAG and the Smol / Indie / Revival Web

thoughts: 

Users vs. Visitors vs. Guests?

Efficiency and ease of use vs. wanting a visitor to take their time.

Not wanting to make it harder, but more exploratory.

Not necessarily mutually exclusive.

## Here's a little of what I hope to cover:
- Disability spectrum
- Semantic HTML
- Image ALT text
- Focusable elements
- Responsive (zoomable) design
- Colors and contrast
- Using dev tools
