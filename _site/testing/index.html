      <h1 id="testing">Testing</h1>
<p>This is a tricky thing, as most of us don't personally have a Braille display, an input switch plus software, or several visual impairments we can turn on and off to test our websites with.</p>
<h2 id="tabbing">Tabbing</h2>
<p>Just hit that tab key! Watch it jump between any links and buttons you have in your page.</p>
<p>Check that the tabbing order makes sense, and that everything you want a person to be able to activate or give input to is available in the tabbing order.</p>
<p>Can't see anything change? You have tabs and links but nothing is happening? It might be your LINK TO FOCUS STYLES</p>
<h2 id="screen-readers">Screen readers</h2>
<p>We can of course install screen readers (SRs), but they do have a learning curve, and even a very experienced sighted accessibility consultant won't use them quite like a blind person will.</p>
<p>That said, it's worth a try to fire up either the built-in SR in your operating system (VoiceOver for MacOS, Narrator for Windows, and Orca is available for Linux), look up its keyboard controls and have a listen to what it says and how it progresses down the page.</p>
<p>If you run Windows, NVDA (free) and JAWS (free trial allows 40-min sessions) are by far the most popular SRs, and can be easily downloaded and installed. LINKS TO FOLLOW</p>
